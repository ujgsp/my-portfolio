As a developer I run into problems every day. Whenever possible, I try to publish my solutions as open source software so others can benefit and build upon them.

Some projects are simple PHP packages, others are full blown web applications or SaaS products and others are shell scripts to automate tedious "borings" tasks.

My projects are being used in organisations like GitHub, Shopify, Laravel, Etherum or Bun and by many fellow developers around the world.

If you've benefited from my projects, consider supporting me through a monthly or one-time donation on GitHub Sponsors.
